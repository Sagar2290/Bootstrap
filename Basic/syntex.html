=> What Is bootstrap :

Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier 
web development

Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for 

typography, 
forms, 
buttons, 
tables, 
navigation, 
modals, 
image carousels/slider and many other, 
as well as optional JavaScript plugins

Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
Responsive web design is about creating web sites which 
automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, 
from small phones to large desktops.

=>Why Use Bootstrap?

Advantages of Bootstrap:

Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can 
start using Bootstrap

Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts 
to phones, tablets, and desktops

Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part 
of the core framework

Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern 
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera)




Bootstrap 5 vs. Bootstrap 3 & 4
Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap; 
with new components, 
faster stylesheet and 
more responsiveness.

Bootstrap 5 supports the latest, 
stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. 
However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, 
is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery.


Where to Get Bootstrap 5?
There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 5 on your own web site.

You can:

1)Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>


Download Bootstrap 5 from getbootstrap.com

  
==>Create First Web Page With Bootstrap 4

1. Add the HTML5 doctype

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
</html>

2. Bootstrap 5 is mobile-first

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
